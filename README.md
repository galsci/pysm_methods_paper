# PySM Method paper

All files should only be edited via Overleaf.

We have an automatic hourly backup to the [`galsci/pysm_methods_paper`](https://github.com/galsci/pysm_methods_paper/) on Github.
This is only for backup or for browsing Jupyter Notebooks in a better interface.

Still, *if you know what you are doing*, you can push to Overleaf from `git` using [the Overleaf git integration](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Git_integration).
