# PySM Methods paper

**Latest versions:** [ApJ publication](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adf212) Â· [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20452)

The paper is automatically synchronized from Overleaf to the Github repository [`galsci/pysm_methods_paper`](https://github.com/galsci/pysm_methods_paper/) hourly.

It is recommended to work on the paper text only via Overleaf, to avoid the problem of having multiple people working on the same piece of text and then having to manually handle conflicts.

Working instead on Jupyter Notebooks and figures is better handled by opening a Pull Request on Github, so we can have a round of reviews before having code merged into the repositories and we can have atomic commits, instead of the bundled commits created by Overleaf.
